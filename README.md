# CN-RDT

This sender and receiver will communicate with each other through an intermediary server running on gaia.cs.umass.edu, as shown below in Figure, that will function as an unreliable channel connecting this sender and receiver. This sender and receiver will each send messages to the server, and the server will relay (after possibly corrupting, losing or delaying but not reordering) the message to the other side.
